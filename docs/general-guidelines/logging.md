# Logging

- General
   - Logging best practices???
- Log levels
   - What goes at what level
      - Log levels in different ecosystems
- Log content
   - Important things & events to log
      - Tag
   - Always include context (ideally provided by logging framework); i.e. line number, class & method, relevant exception etc
   - Processability (consider grep, parsing, use in dashboards)
   - Content to avoid in logs
      - Secrets
      - (Potentially) personal information at >= INFO level
         - (user)names, IP addresses, e-mail, address, etc
         - CLARIN policy/statement (re GDPR)
      - Long content (can frameworks help you - formatting options)
- Log frameworks
   - See language specific suggestions in section above
- Prepare for log aggregation: fluent
   - log parsing
      - Parse at the 'source' (i.e. local fluent config in image)
      - Conventions / vocabulary for field names (with types)
         - Full message, timestamp, log level, context, ...
      - Required fields
         - Include full/original/unparsed message
      - Recommended fields
         - Timestamp
- Log configurations
   - Main log level(s) should be configurable
      - At container level for main process(es) via environment variable(s)
   - Other logging configuration
      - Nice if it can be overridden
- Special cases
   - Timing
      - Include unit
   - Process start/stop
   - Progress
   - Heartbeat
   - ...
- Smells / bad practices
   - Extensive logging for debugging (especially if not cleaned up)
   - Expensive calculations in log messages (especially if not lazy)
