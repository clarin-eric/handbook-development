images.

Our applications and services are packed as container images, following the
[open container initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/) specification,
using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Ideally containers `SHOULD` run one
process per container in the foreground. In practice this is not always easy
depending on the situation. Newly developed services are more easy to fit into
this model by taking this requirement into account from the design stage
already. For existing services it can be more challenging to fit this model.

For the CLARIN infrastructre we have created a set of base images, based on
the [alpine linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine),
to provide an environment where we can more easily deploy existing services.
These environments provide a supervisord daemon as the main process. The
supervisord daemon [^SUPERVISORD] manages a couple of additional processes 
aimed at streamlining integration into our infrastructure. These processes are:

* td-agent [^TDAGENT], to tag and manage log output in the single stdout stream
  of the container. Typically applications such as nginx, postgres, tomcat, etc
  write multiple log files with different types of information. Td-agent allows
  us to tag each of these streams so that these can be identified in the single
  container stdout stream.
* cron [^CROND], a cron deamon to periodically run tasks inside the container.
  This is used sparsely and might be removed at a later point in time.
* logrotate [^LOGROTATE], because we have processes running inside the container
  that writes log data to files, we use the logrotate daemon to be able to
  ensure log files are properly rotated and cleaned.

Most important base images:

* [docker-alpine-base](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-alpine-base)
   * [docker-alpine-supervisor-base](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-alpine-supervisor-base)
      * [docker-alpine-supervisor-java-base](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-alpine-supervisor-java-base)
         * [docker-alpine-supervisor-java-tomcat-base](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-alpine-supervisor-java-tomcat-base)
      * [docker-alpine-fpm-base](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/docker-alpine-fpm-base)

* ðŸ‘‰ When developing a new image, you `SHOULD` base you image on the 
  `docker-alpine-supervisor-base` base image or any of its base image
  descendants.

Container images that go together to offer a functional service, e.g. a
frontend, backend and a database, are typically grouped into
deployable projects via [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

* ðŸ‘‰ (Compose) Projects are what we deploy and run on our infrastructure via the
CLARIN [deploy script](https://gitlab.com/CLARIN-ERIC/deploy-script).

We are currently supporting the following versions:

* Docker engine version `20.10.x`.
* Docker compose yaml version `3.1`.

`TODO` Provide a link to the operational docker guidelines.

## Upstream proxies

Software projects (compose projects) should have an nginx in front of the
application to work as the upstream server.  This is because we want:

1. The upstreams to be uniform so that in the future we can deploy client /
   server authentication between the proxy and the upstreams in a standard way.
2. Non-standard webserver configurations that are specific to a certain
   applications (e.g. SNI), will be deployed in the application project itself.
   Avoiding split logic.
3. The application should respond to all their requests on the same upstream
   port. Again, wherever possible making the central proxy configuration
   unaware  of the need for different ports.

If possible this should apply to all applications meant to run behind our
central proxy. (Maybe we can augment our compose project init code to add this
nginx by default)

There may be multiple nginx services in the same compose project as a result.
One would be the dedicated proxy service. This is a desirable situation.
